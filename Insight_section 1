Q2
As of my experience and part taking in the current year (Freshmen Year) was something that will always be rememberable. Recollection my memories major things I have been part of were helping out in Mood Indigo and Techfest. Yes, I know its is not so lustrous, but I have got to say it was kind of fun as I had never helped organize an event before. As of sports, in NSO I was enrolled in squash. A sport which I had just heard of, and never even seen the equipment or court in my life. But from NSO squash I leant the unexpected can sometimes be the most miraculous things. After few sessions when I got a hang of it I and some of my friend eventually started playing it in our free time. And we can also added the minor events of taking part in the annual quiz of Krittika and few more from finance and analytics club.
